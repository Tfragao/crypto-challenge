# crypto-challenge

# For the time been to run the challenges on your local machine, do the following:
    -> Go to the folder (challenge1, challenge2 or challenge3, etc) from there in the terminal run,
    >> cmake --build 
    then you can run the program by
    >> ./main (for now I am running it in a macOs machine)
